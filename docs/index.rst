CCSDS Navigation Data Messages (NDM) Read/Write
=================================================

Description
--------------
The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) develops communications and data systems standards
for spaceflight. `CCSDS Navigation Data Messages (NDM) <https://public.ccsds.org/Publications/MOIMS.aspx>`_
is the set of file standards to define common data types such as trajectory, orbit, attitude and conjunction events.
These data types are routinely generated and exchanged within and between spacecraft operators, space agencies,
researchers, amateurs and commercial companies. As such, accurate definition and common interpretation of the data
is crucial (and sometimes mission-critical).

The standard description for each data type is encapsulated in an XML Schema file. This project `ccsds-ndm` aims to
be the reference open-source Python implementation to read and write the NDM XML files, through an object tree
API, auto-generated by these schema files.

The source code is `on Github <https://github.com/egemenimre/ccsds-ndm>`_ and the documentation is
`on Readthedocs <https://ccsds-ndm.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Usage and Examples
-------------------

There are two use cases:

-   The `ccsds-ndm` library reads the NDM file, fills an object tree and offers it to the users. The users will then
    have to fill their own attitude, orbit or trajectory objects used in their libraries.
-   The user fills an object tree from their own attitude, orbit or trajectory object. The `ccsds-ndm` library
    writes the NDM file using this object tree.

For the first use case, reading an OEM file from `xml_read_path` is as simple as
(file type is inferred automatically):

>>> cdm = NdmIo().from_path(xml_read_path)

The output `cdm` is the object tree for a Conjunction Data Message (CDM). The contents can then be reached
going deeper in the object tree. This example shows how to reach the orbit normal position component
of the relative state vector:

>>> print(cdm.body.relative_metadata_data.relative_state_vector.relative_position_n)

Filling the objects with data properly requires some care. As the standard is understandably strict, the
object tree derived from the XSD files are also rather exacting in how they accept data. Out of these three
different ways of inserting data, the third one is invalid:

>>> # This is valid but missing units information
>>> cdm.body.relative_metadata_data.relative_state_vector.relative_position_r = LengthType(700)
>>>
>>> # This is the proper way to write data into the object
>>> cdm.body.relative_metadata_data.relative_state_vector.relative_position_t = LengthType(Decimal(800), LengthUnits.M)
>>>
>>> # This is invalid
>>> # cdm.body.relative_metadata_data.relative_state_vector.relative_position_r = 600

The output of the above two methods is different on the XML file - the latter is properly
transmitting important unit information:

>>>      <relativeStateVector>
>>>        <RELATIVE_POSITION_R>700</RELATIVE_POSITION_R>
>>>        <RELATIVE_POSITION_T units="m">800</RELATIVE_POSITION_T>

Therefore, care must be taken (and standard documents must be kept as a reference) when mapping
the user objects into the object tree. Valuable information on units, models and methods can be found
there to correctly interpret the data. Also, comments can also be used to provide supplementary information
on how this data is generated.

Finally, once filled with the relevant data, the `cdm` object can be written to `xml_write_path` with:

>>> NdmIo().to_file(cdm, xml_write_path)

The `ndm` object trees are not very user friendly and most probably will have to be filled by the users'
own equivalent objects (trajectory, orbit, attitude etc.).

Installing `ccsds-ndm`
-----------------------

The `ccsds-ndm` package is on `PyPI`_ and you can install it simply by running::

    pip install ccsds_ndm

You can also install it via `conda-forge`_::

    conda install -c conda-forge ccsds_ndm

Do not install `ccsds-ndm` using `sudo`.

Requirements
------------

-   `xsData` is used to read and write XML files (and also to generate the object tree)
